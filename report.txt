4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Wind Chill)
      Approach: In this problem first I had to get the numbers from the terminal and store it into a float variable.
      Next I created a if and elif statement to check if the temperature is less than 50 degrees and
      the wind above 3mph Then I created a variable and stored the equation that the writeup gave us.
      Lastly I displayed the answer onto the terminal.

      Issues and resolution: I had difficulty with converting the equation that was given to me to python code
      It caused me to try to write and test the equation on multiple occasions to make sure I put the parenthesis
      in the correct place. I did not put enough parenthesis in between (0.4275 * t) - 35.75. but found out I
      should have added an extra set of parenthesis in between. After fixing it, the answer displayed was correct.

   Problem 2 (Day of the Week)
      Approach: In this problem first I had to get the numbers from the terminal and store it into a int variable.
      Next I created multiple int variable and stored the equation that the writeup gave us to find the exact date.
      Then I used if and elif statements and set each number 0-6 equal to sunday to saturday. Lastly I displayed the
      date onto the terminal from the input.

      Issues and resolution: I had difficulty with converting the equation that was given to me to python code
      It caused me to try test the equation on multiple occasions to make sure I was converting
      the equation to the right format. I did not variable of the equation to an int, and I used regular division.
      But found out I needed to convert the variable to in by having int() around the equation.
      I also had to se floor division // instead of regular division /. After fixing it, the answer
      displayed was correct.

   Problem 3 (Playing Card)
      Approach: In this problem first I had first randomized a number between 2 and 15 to represent each of the cards
      Next I randomized a number between 1 and 5 to represent each of the suits. Then I used if and elif
      statements to set the random number equal to a card that represents the same number and a number
      that represents a certain suit. Lastly I displayed the card and the suit onto the screen.

      Issues and resolution: I had difficulty trying to figure out how to not use each number
      to represent that same number using an if and elif statement. It caused me to use lots of
      elif statements in my code. I did not need to write all the extra elif statements.
      But found out I use an else statement and convert the random number to a string instead of using a bunch of
      elif statements. After fixing it, I used alot less code than I did first.
